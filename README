# This is a modification to Febrl's data set generator to faciliate generation
# of large (gigabyte) sets. See "generate_bigdata.py".

# -------------------
# My changes allow dsgen to produce sizable datasets that exceed memory 
# constraints. It writes to records to disk, and generates a proportional 
# number of duplicates at regular intervals of a million original records 
# (approx 100mb). The catch is that the output is not randomly sorted 
# even for small files. You should run another script if you need sorted data.
